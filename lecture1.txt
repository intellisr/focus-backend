However, the modern computer was developed in 1930s, when Conrad's use created the first programmable computer, the Z1, which could do additions and subtractions very quickly. In 1941, he created the Z3 known as the world's oldest digital computer. Unfortunately, the computer was disordered.

Another important moment in history, an evolution of the computer was also in 1941, when J.V. Atanasov, a physics and math teacher, and his student Clifford Berry designed a computer that could solve 29 equations simultaneously. However, at Atanasov Berry, computer was the first computer capable of storing data in its memory.

It was used during World War II to break the complex Lorenz cyfers used by the Nazis. Colossus offered immediate solutions and its belief that it significantly shortened the duration of the war. Another computer that stood out at the time was Enyak, created by John Machelie and Bresbur Eckerd. The computer was created for ballistic analysis used by the military during World War II.

A few years later, the two built UNIVAC, the first commercial computer for business and government applications. Another important step in the evolution of computers was the time when transistors replaced vacuum tubes. Thus, in 1953, the first prototype computer with transistors was created, Manchester, TC. In 1953, great.

In the early 1960s, IBM launched the 7,000 series of mainframe computers that used transistors. The 703-0 model also called Stretch was part of this series, with nine such computers being sold to scientific laboratories. The technologies used for this computer led to the development of the IBM 360. IBM's most successful series.

In 1965, Program 101 was the first desktop computer sold to General Public. It cost $3,200, was the size of the typewriter, had 37 keys and a built-in printer. At the same time, the world's first 16-bit commercial microcomputer, the DDP-116, was developed and sold for $28,500. DDP-1970 is marked

A year later IBM invented the floppy disk, which allows data to be shared between computers. Now who hasn't heard of Altair 8800? It was launched in 1975 and used the basic programming language developed by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Altair 8800 was a very popular computer being the model that invented the term, personal computer.
audio/2023-09-03 10:28:07.888166| 1976 Apple appeared on the computer market with the Apple One. The first computer with a single circuit board and ROM, to which you had to add a keyboard, a power supply and a case. A year later, they launched Apple Two, which was a great success. It was an 8-bit computer and came with a switching power supply, keyboard case, manual, game paddles and a box containing the breakout game. In 1981, IBM launched the first IBM PC, officially known as the IBM

This was the computer that revolutionized the development of computers, being cloned on a large scale and thus generating the creation of so many softwares and peripherals. Apple launched Apple Lisa in 1983, the first personal computer to have a graphical user interface. It had a drop-down menu and icons, a Motorola,

Successful computer mouse with a graphical user interface and based on the Motorola 6-800-microprocessor. In 1984, Michael Dell created PCs Limited, where he created the first self-designed computer called TurboPiece.
audio/2023-09-03 10:29:37.918452| In the early 1990s, Dell was one of the leading computer developers. In 1987, IBM released personal system 2. The first IBM system with the Intel 80386 chip. The computer also came with the new operating system OS2, which for the first time allowed users of a mouse or IBM computers. The 1990s were marked by an innovation introduced by Apple. Their new iMacs, the 1998 G3, came with clear, customizable case. It was so cool.

In 2003, it launched the Apple G5, the most powerful Macintosh to date. The computer had anodized aluminium case and was named the first through 64-bit personal computer. So, in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, personal computers began to be widely used in all fields.

Thus, the market for computer confidence began to grow more and more, but users being able to create their own PC system according to their own needs. Moreover, it is incredible how from computers that occupy an entire room and perform very simple actions. Technology has come to offer us today very small PCs such as the Apple Mac Mini Desktop PC system, which offers very high performance when working or doing a gaming system.
