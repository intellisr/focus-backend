audio/2023-09-10 11:30:39.715759| Well, thank you.
audio/2023-09-10 11:31:09.729210| Hello friends, welcome back to our channel. So in the previous session we have seen the Java buzz words so that we call it as a feature. In this session let us have a look on the oops concepts. So what are the oops concepts? All the
audio/2023-09-10 11:31:39.728580| object, gas, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
audio/2023-09-10 11:32:09.747310| So, this we call as Oops concepts. Now, let us see one by one. First, what is meant by object? It is an object is defined as a real world entity. So, whatever the thing we are seeing in the real world, that can be treated as an object. So, this object is a real world entity.
audio/2023-09-10 11:32:39.767436| And this object consists of properties and the task performed by this object. So whatever the real world entity which is having this properties and the task, some task to prepare for those we call as an object.
audio/2023-09-10 11:33:09.783172| Let us take an example. Human. Human being is also an entity. It is also an object. So human possess of properties like name, So color.
audio/2023-09-10 11:33:39.801812| So, these are the properties. So, what this human can do? The task. One of the tasks can be done by this human. Work, run, and lead, right, etc. So, these are the tasks can be performed by this human. So, we can consider this human as a...
audio/2023-09-10 11:34:09.802616| object, right. Hope you understood. So, object is a real world entity which is having the properties and some tasks that it can be performed, right. No, what about the class? So, class is a blueprint that object should object follows.
audio/2023-09-10 11:34:39.802884| object follows. So it is a blueprint that an object follows. So without the class object is not there. So this class consists of n number of objects, number of objects. It consists of a number of objects and an object can be defined as instance of a class, instance of a class object. So that is a class object. So that is a class object. So that is an
audio/2023-09-10 11:35:09.824065| So that means object will follow the prototype defined by this class. Example, let us take a student, student in a class, student in a classroom. So what are the properties? So properties are variables, we can say them as variables. So properties of a student. One, student name.
audio/2023-09-10 11:35:39.842567| student rule number and student data of drawing data of drawing right so this is a class and all the objects which are defined by this class should follow this problem. For example, a student in a class there are n number of students every student can be considered as an object.
audio/2023-09-10 11:36:09.853156| which follows the same property and one of the tasks to be performed by the student, read, write. So, every student can have three properties, read, write, read. So, every student can have three properties, read, write, read, read. Every student will be having the three properties named November and some take-off
audio/2023-09-10 11:36:39.872622| So whatever the objects created through this class will follow the same structure that means objects. So student consists of a number of objects. So student class consists of some ABC the name of a student ABC some D, F, some G, H, so ABC will be having name.
audio/2023-09-10 11:37:09.872873| Remember, dead of joy. Name, Remember, dead of joy. Similarly, JHA. So here, the agency, D, and JHA are the mates, name of a student. Let it be like something, something, and some solution. Remember, and dead of joy. And, from every student
audio/2023-09-10 11:37:39.873785| will follow some properties some rate right end plane. So, excuse me, this free properties can be done I mean inrope by this LBC and this properties can be applied for DAF and this properties can be done by JHI. So, an object is an instance of a class and a class is a blueprint that the object should follow right. So, a class consists of n number of
audio/2023-09-10 11:38:09.892282| objects, many number of objects. Hope you understood this object in class because our Java programming completely deals with these two things, class and object. For everything we will create a class and we will create an object. So a class cannot run the methods of another class directly. So one class of methods cannot be invoked by another class. So in order to access the methods of another class, one class of methods,
audio/2023-09-10 11:38:39.904482| one class should create its own object. So simply we can say a classes cannot communicate with each other, but in order to communicate with each other, objects should be created. So for every communication object should be created. So if class here and class B wants to communicate. So here the communication means in looking the methods of one class by another class. So every class is having the methods, right? So task. So in looking those methods are passed.
audio/2023-09-10 11:39:09.905211| from one class to another class is called a communication and this cannot be done between two classes and this can be done only between objects. So in order to communicate two classes first the instances should be generated and through those instances the two classes will be communicated. So hope you understood this thing the class and object.
