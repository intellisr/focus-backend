The dimensions of speed is the dimension of length divided by the dimension of time. So I can write for that bracket L divided by bracket time. Whether it's meters per second or inches per year, that's not what matters. It has the dimension, lengths per time. Volume.
audio/2023-06-21 21:27:05.632696| Tell me! Would have the dimension of length to the power 3. Density would have the dimension of mass per unit volume, so that means length to the power 3. All important in our course is acceleration. We will do all of this.
audio/2023-06-21 21:27:35.652022| What was the acceleration? Acceleration that you will see his length for time. You don't have to make me take quite long- But when I see you have to get closer hisgey is promised You have to take that hand Is that two peoplePlease?
